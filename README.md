The basics ...
- given the explosion that is about to happen, this large design flaw has been decided to be a big enough issue to fix
- break up the draw function into smaller functions (all of which can be called by draw, ultimately, but can be unit tested by themselves too
- pick 3 or 4 functions to pull out, all of them should have a small number of unit tests written against them
  - 1 of these unit tests should be failing (maybe the same failing one as in the other path? double-down??)


Talking points:
- now you have code that will be much easier for new people to work with and maintain
- can debug issues faster and with more specific clarity
- value is shown to the owners in the above ^^

Test cases:
