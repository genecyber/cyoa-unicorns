```
You dodge to the left and fall into a jungle of acceptance tests...
```

```
The basics ...
- putting in the framework takes time
- but ... 3 acceptance test later, there is some more clarity around the state of the application from a higher-level perspective (I mean, non-coders can see the test run and pass and see their value
- if all of those tests pass, though, what is the benefit?
  - domain language
  - all on the same page
  - act as regression
  - owners can see state and value
 
Test Cases that should be in this branch (cucumber/selenium tests):
- 

Notes on choices:
- Yay! We see value in high level tests and our test strategy is sound; let's add new features
- We're on a roll! Let's add a bunch more acceptance tests!
