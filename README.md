Once upon a time a funny story was written for Starwest and YOU were put in charge. 

Will you survive or will you die of dysentery?

```
The basics:  
- This codebase has been worked on with no testers or focus on testing in general for some time
- worked on by a few people who are developers and subject matter experts
- growth is expected to explode very soon, adding many more features and many more exployees to work on the codebase
- new test lead comes in and should choose where to focus attention first
- owners want to see quick benefit from testing strategy chosen
- for the first 1 rainbow worth of effort, which direction do you choose?

You are standing in an open field west of a white house. The house is still under construction, and appears to be coming along... You talk to one person working on the house, and he tells you that nobody has come to do any inspections yet, but as far as the workers can tell, everything is as it should be.

Around the back of the house you see a long line of people, all of them holding little white envelopes. They seem very eager to help with the house.

There are two mailboxes here.

The first mailbox is simply labeled "<unit tests fun word>".

The second is mysteriously labeled "<acceptance tests fun word>".

Both are overflowing.

Choose which box to open.
```

If you choose <Unit Tests Fun Word>: [turn to page 23](../page-23/README.md)

If you choose <Acceptance Tests Fun Word>: [turn to page 42](../page-42/README.md)
